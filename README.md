# Animated Binary Search Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the Binary Search algorithm with an interactive and animated interface. The project allows users to visualize how binary search works step by step on a randomly generated list of numbers.

You can try the live version of the project here: [Binary Search Live Demo](https://roland-mehes.github.io/Binary-Search/)

## Features:

- Visualizes each step of the binary search algorithm.
- Allows the user to enter a number to search for within a randomly generated list.
- Displays the list and highlights the current search range (min, mid, max).
- A button for users to step through the search process one step at a time.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use:

1. **Start the Program:**

   - When the page loads, a random list of numbers is generated.

2. **Enter a Number:**

   - You can type a number into the input field and click the **Enter** button to start searching for that number in the list.

3. **Step Through the Search:**

   - Click the **Next** button to move through the steps of the binary search. Each step will visually highlight the current range being searched (min, mid, max) and the algorithmâ€™s progress.

4. **View the Result:**
   - If the number is found, the algorithm will stop at the index where the number was located.
   - If the number is not in the list, an alert will notify the user that the number is not in the field.
